* Tasks

Define common tasks (shell commands) to be run in a specific project.

** Usage

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (define-task rails-db-migrate
    :command "bundle exec rails db:migrate"
    :project-path "~/Code/my-rails-project"
    :description "Run rails db:migrate in my rails project")
#+end_src

This will create an interactive function ~rails-db-migrate~ that will run the
the described command as an ~async-shell-command~.

*** Available params

**** Mandatory

- ~:command~: The shell command to run

**** Optional

- ~:project-path~: Where to run the shell command, default to the current
  directory instead
- ~:description~: The descritpion of the interactive function.  Can be useful if
  you use Marginalia.
- ~:async~: Default to ~true~ but can be set to ~nil~ if you need to run
  ~shell-command~ instead.

*** Project integration

If a ~:project-path~ corresponds to a project used by emacs's ~project.el~ you
can easily lists the commands it this project with ~C-x p C-t~.
